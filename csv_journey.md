# Steps I took on working in csv I files
### my minimap
a. load the data
b. inspect the data
c. clean the data
d. explore the data
e. transform the data
f. store the data

## what I learnt
a. the essentials when it comes working with pandas to clean data and load data like using the read_csv and to_csv
b. increased my knowledge on python like how to write basic functions
c. how to use relative paths instead of hard cording, with the use of 'r""' in inputting and outputting data

## what challenged me
a. the analysis of data 
b. plotting of data
c. coming up with insights
d. what to remove and what to keep

## how was my journey
It was first a joy ride on the extraction path while loading a csv file; Then proved a small challenge in the trasnforming of data and the peddle stone was working with database had to learn how to write configuration files to store to a db file. However my skills in writing sql came in handy as I used pandas to clean data and after loading used SQL to answer my analysis question.
It was smile, frown then calmness and joy
The cycle is to repeat; I have done all the ETL on Insurance raw file hence I must proceed to understand areas I have forgotten or fall short in understanding concepts
